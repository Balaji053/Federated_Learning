*Prediction of Solar Radiation on given weather data
These datasets are meteorological data from the HI-SEAS weather station from four months (September through December 2016)
•	Dataset consists different features like
•	Solar radiation [W/m^2]
•	Temperature [F]
•	Atmospheric pressure [Hg]
•	Humidity [%]
•	Wind speed [miles/h]
•	Wind direction [degrees]
Our objective is to derive an ML model to forecast the solar radiation as a function of available features.
